# Eshop - Full-Stack Microservices E-commerce Platform

Welcome to **Eshop**, a modern, full-stack e-commerce platform built with a microservices architecture. This project uses an Nx monorepo to manage a distributed system, including separate frontends for users and sellers, and a suite of backend services for handling everything from authentication to real-time chat.

## ✨ Features

- **Monorepo Structure**: Managed with Nx for streamlined, scalable development and shared code.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decoupled services for auth, products, orders, and chat.
- **Dual Frontend**:
  - **User UI** (`user-ui`): A Next.js app for customers to browse, shop, and manage their accounts.
  - **Seller UI** (`seller-ui`): A Next.js app for sellers to manage products, view orders, and see analytics.
- **API Gateway**: A single, unified entry point (`api-gateway`) for all frontend requests, which then routes to the appropriate microservice.
- **Async Communication**: Kafka (`kafka-service`) is used for event-driven communication and analytics, ensuring services are loosely coupled.
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket-based chat (`chatting-service`) for live communication between users and sellers.
- **Modern Database**: Uses Prisma as a next-generation ORM for type-safe database access (likely with PostgreSQL).
- **Caching**: Redis is integrated for high-performance caching and session management.
- **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.
- **CI/CD**: Includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) for automated deployment.
- **AI Enhancements**: The seller dashboard includes utilities for AI-powered features (e.g., `Ai.enhancement.ts`).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project is designed as a distributed system. The `apps/` directory contains all the runnable applications (frontends and microservices), while the `packages/` directory contains shared code (like components, middleware, and library clients).

### Flow of a Request

1. A user (in `user-ui`) or seller (in `seller-ui`) performs an action.
2. The Next.js frontend sends an API request to the **API Gateway** (`api-gateway`).
3. The API Gateway verifies the request (often using middleware from `packages/middleware`) and forwards it to the correct backend service (e.g., `product-service`).
4. The service performs its business logic, communicating with the Prisma client (`packages/libs/prisma`) and Redis (`packages/libs/redis`).
5. For asynchronous tasks (like sending analytics or generating a report), the service publishes an event to a Kafka topic.
6. The `kafka-service` (or another interested service) consumes this event and processes it independently.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the entire platform up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Nx CLI** (Install globally: `npm install -g nx`)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the root dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbanujsingh1400/eshop.git
cd eshop
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

This project requires several environment variables for database connections, API keys, and service-to-service communication.

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project. You will need to add variables for:

- `DATABASE_URL` (for Prisma, e.g., `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/eshop`)
- `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT`
- `KAFKA_BROKERS`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY`, `IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT`
- ...and any other keys used by the services (e.g., email provider keys)

> **Note**: You may need to create `.env` files within each service in `apps/` or manage this through a single root file, depending on how the `docker-compose.yml` is configured to inject them.

### 3. Build Docker Images

Before running, build all the necessary images using Docker Compose. This will read the `docker-compose.yml` file and build all the services defined within it.

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 4. Initialize the Database

The database needs to be running, and the schema needs to be applied.

**Start the database service** (and other core services like Kafka/Redis):

```bash
# Check your docker-compose.yml for service names (e.g., db, postgres)
docker-compose up -d db kafka redis
```

**Apply the Prisma schema**:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

**Generate the Prisma Client**:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 5. Run the Platform

Once the images are built and the database is ready, you can start the entire platform.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all services in detached mode. You can view logs for all services or a specific service:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f           # All services
docker-compose logs -f user-ui   # Just the user-ui service
```

Your applications should now be running (ports may vary based on your configuration):

- **User UI**: http://localhost:3000
- **Seller UI**: http://localhost:3001
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8000

### Development with Nx (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run services individually for development (e.g., against a shared Docker DB), you can use the Nx CLI.

```bash
# Serve the user-ui
npx nx serve user-ui

# Serve the api-gateway
npx nx serve api-gateway

# Run tests for the auth-service
npx nx test auth-service
```
